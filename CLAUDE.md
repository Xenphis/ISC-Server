# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

ISC (Immersive SoloCraft) is a fork of **TrinityCore** (a WoW 3.3.5 MMORPG server framework), being adapted from a massively-multiplayer server into a client/server framework for a standalone, lore-focused single-player RPG. The client/server architecture is preserved, but the server (worldserver/authserver) is being extended and optimized to support intelligent NPC bots/companions and other single-player-specific features. This is an educational project; no commercial use or mass distribution is intended.

**Architecture conventions for new ISC systems:**
- The project is a full overhaul toward a standalone framework: new core services (managers/singletons) are
  first-class citizens of the core, not add-ons. Initialize them directly in `World::SetInitialWorldSettings`
  (`src/server/game/World/World.cpp`) alongside the other singletons — do NOT use ScriptMgr hooks
  (WorldScript/PlayerScript) to bootstrap core services. Script hooks are reserved for content scripts.

**Coding rules:**
1. **Think before coding.** State assumptions out loud. If a request is ambiguous, ask instead of guessing. If a simpler approach exists, push back on the request rather than silently implementing the more complex one.
2. **Simplicity first.** Write the minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative abstractions, no flexibility nobody asked for.
3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Don't refactor or "improve" neighboring code. Every changed line should trace back to the request.
4. **Goal-driven execution.** Turn vague instructions into verifiable targets before writing code (e.g. "add validation" → "write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass").
5. **All code and comments must be written in English** (docs/ and conversations stay in French).

**Toolchain baseline:** C++23, CMake ≥ 4, Boost ≥ 1.90, OpenSSL ≥ 3, MySQL ≥ 9.

## Build

**Do not configure or build unless explicitly asked**. Builds are slow (CMake + compile of a large C++ codebase) and rarely needed to make code changes.

## Repository layout

**`src/common/`** — networking (Asio), crypto, config, logging, shared utilities.
**`src/server/game/`** — core gameplay; compiled into worldserver.
**`src/server/scripts/`** — content scripts grouped by region (EasternKingdoms/, Northrend/, …), class (Spells/spell_mage.cpp, …), and domain (Commands/, Pet/, OutdoorPvP/, World/).
**`src/server/database/`** — DB abstraction and schema updater.
**`src/server/shared/`** — code shared by auth and world servers.
**`src/server/{authserver,worldserver}/`** — entry points (ports 3724 and 8085).
**`src/tests/`** — Test unit tests + mocks.
**`sql/`** — migration files to update the database. Use only update folder to create migrations.
**`dep/`** — vendored third-party dependencies.
**`client/`** — client-side addons (Lua 5.1, WoW 3.3.5a); `client/AddOns/ISC` implements the ISC protocol (server side: `src/server/game/Server/Protocol/Isc*`).
